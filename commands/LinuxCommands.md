- ip addr show
  - basically ipconfig
- whoami
  - shows the user name of the person using this machine
- pwd
  - shows where you were current working or present working directory
- sudo -i
  - switches from working user to root user
- exit
  - log out of the root user or VM
- cd
  - this moves the user around directories
  - cd .. - is back 1 level
  - cd {dir name} - will try to move up 1 level to that dir
  - cd - alone this will return you to your home dir
  - you can also type out a whole route /home/{user} to move directly to that dir
  - tab will show you possible dirs or auto fill if there is only 1
  - cd ~ is the same as cd
- uptime
  - shows how long this session has been active
- free -m
  - shows how much free memory you have
- mkdir {dirname/s} [-p]
  - creates a new directory in the current directory
  - can create many if seperated by spaces
  - can create an array of directories with {n..n+}
  - you can use -p if you want to create a chain of dirs
    e.g. this/this2/ops/dev/text.txt
- touch {filename}
  - creates a new empty file
  - can create an array of files if you use ..
    - touch devfile{1..10}.txt
- cp {filename} {destination}
  - copies a file to a new directory
  - make sure the directory is in format {dir}/ the / is after not before
  - you can also use this with absolute paths
  - you can copy whole directories if you use -r
    - cp -r dev/ backupdir/
- ls [-l|t|r] {dir}
  - gives a list of every file and dir in the pwd
  - -l option prints a detailed list of the files like time created and permissions of the file
  - -lt will make the table sort by time instead of by alphabet
  - -ltr will sort by time in reverse order
  - is also able to print a directory that is not pwd if given a path
- {any command} --help
  - get help with any command that you type in first
- mv {file} {file || dir}
  - moves a file a new directory or if you declare another file name then it renames the file
  - you can do both at once with an absolute path
  - you can use _ for everything e.g. mv _.txt dev/
- rm [-r] {file || directory}
  - removes a file
  - can remove a directory if you use -r option
  - you can remove everything with rm \*
  - if you want to really remove everything with no questions [DANGEROUS] use rm -rf \*
- history
  - prints out a list of every command used in this session in order
- vim {filename}
  - open the file in the vim editor or if the file doesn't exist then it will open a new file with that name, DOESN'T SAVE AUTOMATICALLY! YOU NEED TO USE :w
- ln [-s] {path to file} {name for link}
  - this is used for creating links in your code, like shortcuts
  - optional -s means your saving a brand new one
- unlink {file}
  - removes the shortcut to links
  - safer than rm because it cannot remove file only links
- grep [-i | R | v] {word} {file}
  - searches the file for that word
  - -i ignores case sensitivity
  - you can use \* for the file if you want to search all files
  - -R will search all directories recursively
  - -v will return everything that does NOT match your word
- less {file}
  - a reader, acts like vim but you cant edit
  - /{word} lets you seach a file for a word
- more {file}
  - like less but is meant to just read, worse than less
- head [-#] {file}
  - shows you the first # of lines from the file
  - default is 10
- tail [-# | f] {file}
  - shows you last # of lines from the file,
  - default is 10
  - -f will show dynamic changes in the file, the editor will stay open and you can quit with ctrl+c, this is good for log files
- cut -d{string} -f{#} /etc/passwd
  - -d{string} is the delimiter you are splitting by
  - -f{#} is the colomn that you are returning or field
  - returns a sample of a file that is seperated by a common string
- awk -F'{string}' '{print ${#}}'
  - this is just a better cut
  - replace string with delimiter or sting you want to cut by
  - {#} is the colomn returned
- sed 's/{search}/{replace}[/g]' {file}
- uptime
  - how long its been running and some other stuff
- free -m
  - free memory in the system
- dh -f
  - shows file and directory sizes
- echo {stirng} [> {file}]
  - just outputs the string in the terminal
  - \> sends the string to a file
  - \>> sends the string to the end of the file
- wc -l {file}
  - this outputs how many lines there are
- find {dir} -name {search}
  - searches a directory for a string
- useradd {username}
- groupadd {groupname}
- id {username}
- usermod -aG {group} {user}
  - gets a user account and adds a group to it.
- passwd {user}
  - adds a pass to the user
- pass
  - if you want to change your own pass
- su {user}
  - switches user
- last
  - shows user logins and who is currently logged in
- userdel {user}
- userdel -r {user} removes the user's home dir also
- chown [-R] {user}:{group} {dir}
  - changes the owner of a dir, use -R to make it
- chmod [-option...] mode[,mode] file|directory
  - chmod ugo+r file
  - chmod o-wx dir
- visudo
  - lets you edit the sudo file in a vim like editor
- arch
  - tells you the architecture of the os
- rpm -qa
